Sex life - is an important theme that people like to ignore. They feel nervous when they have to speak about it. But we all involved into it.
One of my closest friends knows how to have safe and good sex life very well. Sometimes people ask her about it and she tells me about a lot of people, who harm yourself and their partners because they dodn't know enough information. That's really sad that people can't (or don't want to) get information and at the result they have to attend a doctor.
Sometimes lack of information and experience can make you sad or nervous. Your relations with your partner may become more harmfull because we all make mistakes and even don't know about it. 
That's a good trend that more people tries to know more about this theme and that's why I'm sure that application for searching info and managing sex life is a good idea.
